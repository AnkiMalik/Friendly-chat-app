# Friendly-chat-app

This chatting application enables you to send text messages and photos to your friends and family memebers.
This application uses Google FIREBASE services to handle the backend of the app.
I have used database, storage, remoteConfig and analytics properties to analyse the real time performance of this application.

It lets you sign-in with google or a basic email id. 
It uses pod files and its directories accordingly.
